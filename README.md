# cyberpunk_mod_manager
Simple mod manager for cyberpunk
# ###WARNING
* It might corrupt your cyberpunk install
* It won't work with mods that replace certain files as it will delete the replaced file instead of restoring it to its original state

# How it works
The mod manager only tries to check if the mod zip file downloaded from (Preferably nexus mods) still has its files in your cyberpunk directory, if not it can move them there to install it for you or remove them by comparing the file structure of the original mod zip file to the files in the cyberpunk install dir

# Why did I make this
I am constantly bricking my Cyberpunk install by trying out new mods and I just wanted a quick and easy way to test mods
